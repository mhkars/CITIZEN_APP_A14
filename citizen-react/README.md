Assuming we have a Citizen Data like below:

{
  "isCitizen": true,
  "Name": "John Smith",
  "ID": 123456,
  "Children": {
    "Mike Smith": 123457,
    "Jessica Smith": 123458,
    "Sarah Smith": 123459
  },
  "hasDrivingLicense": true
}
{
  "isCitizen": false,
  "Name": "Michael Tall",
  "ID": 123461,
  "Children": {
  },
  "hasDrivingLicense": false
}
{
  "isCitizen": false,
  "Name": "Joe Bloggs",
  "ID": 123462,
  "Children": {
    "Sarah Bloggs": 123463
  },
  "hasDrivingLicense": true
} ...


Steps to achieve:

1.	Using Spring Boot and Java 11 implement the steps listed below. 
2.	Fetch this data from a relational database using Spring Data JPA using ER.
3.	Write a REST API to deliver the data. API is expected to contain the endpoints below:
a.	Get citizen list as per a filter by isCitizen, Name (contains), Number of Children, hasDrivingLicense.
b.	Get specific citizen by ID. If no citizen with given ID exists then return proper HTTP response
c.	Add/Update a Citizen. ID is autogenerated by the system and is unique
d.	Children also should exist in the system as citizens. Otherwise return proper HTTP response.

4.	Write a separate React frontend to filter and list the records 
5.	Return number of records by the API and display on the page
